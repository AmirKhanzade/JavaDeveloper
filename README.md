In this lab, you took a deep dive into the concepts of classes, objects, and methods in Java. You explored defining more than one class (Rectangle, and Circle), including a utility class (ShapeMetricCalculator), that focused on calculating areas of various shapes.

This repository contains a set of 4 Java files designed to demonstrate object-oriented programming (OOP) principles by calculating properties of geometric shapes: circles and rectangles. The code emphasizes reusability, encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism to perform calculations and manage shape-related data.

The project serves as a learning resource for understanding OOP concepts in Java through a practical implementation. It highlights how to design clean, modular, and extensible code for solving real-world problems involving shapes.
